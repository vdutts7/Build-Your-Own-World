This project builds and displays the “smart” pieces of a web-browser based Google Maps clone. The project is broken into three key parts. 

  - Map rastering (providing images of appropriate resolution given coordinates)
  - Routing (street directions based on latitude and longitude)
  - Autocomplete features
